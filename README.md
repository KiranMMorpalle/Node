# Node
Got it ✅
If your goal is to land a **Node.js developer role at top startups**, the syllabus should not just cover “how to use Node.js” — it needs to make you **production-ready** with API design, scaling, testing, and deployment skills, plus the ecosystem tools startups use every day.

Here’s a **structured Node.js syllabus** broken into **5 progressive stages**, with hiring-level skills in mind:

---

## **Stage 1 — Core Node.js Fundamentals (2–3 weeks)**

**Goal:** Understand Node.js runtime, asynchronous nature, and essential modules.
**Topics:**

* Node.js Overview

  * What Node.js is and where it’s used in startups
  * V8 engine basics
  * Event loop & non-blocking I/O
* Core Modules

  * `fs` (File System)
  * `path`, `os`, `url`
  * `events` (EventEmitter)
  * `http` (Create HTTP server)
* NPM & Package Management

  * Installing, updating, versioning packages
  * `package.json` & `package-lock.json`
* Asynchronous Patterns

  * Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`
  * Error handling in async code
* Environment Variables

  * `.env` files, `process.env`

**Mini Projects:**

* CLI tool that reads/writes JSON files
* Basic HTTP server that serves HTML/CSS/JS files

---

## **Stage 2 — Express.js & REST API Development (2–3 weeks)**

**Goal:** Build scalable, production-grade APIs.
**Topics:**

* Express.js Fundamentals

  * Routing, middleware
  * Serving static files
  * `req` & `res` objects
* REST API Principles

  * HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  * Status codes & best practices
* Middleware

  * Built-in & custom middleware
  * Logging (`morgan`), body parsing (`body-parser`)
* Request Validation (`joi`, `express-validator`)
* Error Handling & Global Error Middleware
* Postman API testing

**Mini Projects:**

* CRUD API for “Tasks” or “Notes”
* Blog API with validation & error handling

---

## **Stage 3 — Databases & Authentication (3–4 weeks)**

**Goal:** Connect APIs to databases and secure them.
**Topics:**

* Databases

  * MongoDB with Mongoose (NoSQL)
  * PostgreSQL/MySQL with Sequelize/Prisma (SQL)
  * Query optimization basics
* Authentication & Authorization

  * JWT-based auth
  * Session & cookie-based auth
  * Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Security Best Practices

  * Password hashing with `bcrypt`
  * Helmet.js for security headers
  * Preventing XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection

**Mini Projects:**

* User auth API with JWT & MongoDB
* Role-based API for an admin dashboard

---

## **Stage 4 — Advanced Node.js & Production Readiness (4–5 weeks)**

**Goal:** Build startup-level production applications.
**Topics:**

* API Versioning & Documentation (Swagger, Postman docs)
* Caching & Performance

  * Redis caching
  * Rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`)
* File Uploads & Cloud Storage (Multer, AWS S3, Cloudinary)
* Sending Emails & Notifications (`nodemailer`)
* Background Jobs & Queues (Bull.js, Agenda)
* Logging & Monitoring (Winston, PM2, Elastic Stack)
* Real-Time Communication (Socket.io, WebSockets)
* Environment-based Configurations
* Microservices basics with Node.js (optional for extra edge)

**Mini Projects:**

* Real-time chat app with Socket.io
* E-commerce API with cart, orders, payments

---

## **Stage 5 — Deployment, Scaling & Interview Prep (2–3 weeks)**

**Goal:** Deploy, scale, and debug apps like a professional.
**Topics:**

* Git & GitHub for collaboration
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions, CircleCI)
* Deployment

  * Vercel, Render, Railway (for quick)
  * AWS EC2, Docker, Nginx (for production)
* Scaling

  * Clustering in Node.js
  * Load balancing basics
* Debugging & Profiling (`node --inspect`)
* Common Node.js interview topics:

  * Event loop deep dive
  * Streams & buffers
  * Memory leaks in Node.js
  * Difference between `process.nextTick()` & `setImmediate()`

**Mini Projects:**

* Deploy your e-commerce API on AWS with CI/CD
* Optimize API with Redis caching & monitoring

---

## **Final Capstone Project (Startup-Level)**

**Idea:** **SaaS API or MERN Stack Application**

* User authentication (JWT)
* Payment integration (Stripe/Razorpay)
* File uploads (AWS S3)
* Caching (Redis)
* Real-time updates (Socket.io)
* Deployment on AWS/Docker

This one project should **showcase every core Node.js skill** you’ve learned.
